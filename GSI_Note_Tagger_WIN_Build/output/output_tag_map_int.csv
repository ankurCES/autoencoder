CM will assist with linkage to community resources and supports.  - CM spoke with firstName and discussed the benefits of having a trust set up through Hudson valley Legal Services as it will not cost him anything and it will ensure his Medicaid is in place for transportation and the necessary appointments that he needs. firstName was very hesitant to make any changes as he is convinced that the trust will cost him money. CM referred him to Hudson Valley Legal Services and asked him to call them and inquire how the trust is set up and to verify that it does not cost him anything. CM also referred him to his diabetes doctor as he is due for an appointment. firstName stated that he did not want to see the doctor until his feet were better healed. CM explained that this is exactly why his diabetes doctor should see him now because he can observe his feet and evaluate how they are healing as diabetes slows the healing process down.  firstName stated that he goes to the wound center for them to evaluate his feet. CM explained that his diabetes should be evaluated to ensure he doesn't need a medication adjustment. CM offered to make an appointment for firstName but he stated that he would take care of it. firstName also stated that he recently purchased a car for $### and said that he uses the car to get to appointments.  CM will discuss his Medicaid with him in the future after he speaks to Hudson Valley Legal Services and understands that he can have his Medicaid in place without it costing him money out of his pocket.,"placewithout,necessaryappointments,healingprocess,trustset"
